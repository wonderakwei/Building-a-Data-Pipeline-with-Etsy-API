## Introduction
This project aims to create an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for retrieving, processing, and analyzing data from the Etsy marketplace using the Etsy API. The pipeline includes data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis components, allowing for the extraction of valuable insights and information from Etsy's product listings, shop data, reviews, and more.

## System Architecture
The project is designed with the following components:

- Etsy API: Retrieves data like product listings, shop info, and reviews from Etsy.
- Data Ingestion: Fetches and feeds data from Etsy API into the pipeline.
- Data Processing: Cleans, transforms, and enriches the ingested data.
- Data Storage: Utilizes databases or data lakes for storing processed data.
- Data Analysis: Employs tools for insights generation and visualization.

Additionally, it utilizes:

- Apache Airflow: Orchestrates the pipeline and manages PostgreSQL data storage.
- Apache Kafka & Zookeeper: Streams data from PostgreSQL to processing engines.
- Control Center & Schema Registry: Monitors and manages Kafka streams.
- Apache Spark: Executes data processing with master-worker node architecture.
- Cassandra: Stores the finalized data.

## Data Sources
- Etsy API: Provides access to product listings, shop information, reviews, and more from the Etsy marketplace.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Language for data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
- **Etsy API**: Retrieves data from Etsy marketplace.
- **Apache Airflow**: Manages and schedules data pipeline tasks.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores processed data.
- **Docker**: Packages and deploys the data engineering environment.
- **Apache Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark**: Power real-time data processing.
- **Cassandra**: Distributed database for scalable storage.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python installed
- Docker installed
